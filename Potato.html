                    <p>The potato is a starchy root vegetable originally from the Americas, and it's a key food in many places worldwide. Potatoes come from plants called Solanum tuberosum, which belong to the nightshade family.


You can find wild potato plants from the southern United States down to southern Chile. Scientists believe all potatoes originated in what's now southern Peru and the extreme northwest of Bolivia, around 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. People first started growing and using them in the Andes region of South America.


In the 16th century, the Spanish brought potatoes to Europe from the Americas. Since then, they've become a staple food globally. Over thousands of years, people have developed more than 5,000 different types of potatoes through selective breeding.


Potatoes are super important in Europe, especially in Northern and Eastern Europe, where they're still grown a lot. But in the 21st century, places like southern and eastern Asia, especially China and India, have started growing them rapidly too.


Potatoes are related to tomatoes and belong to the same Solanum genus. The green parts of a potato plant contain a toxin called solanine. Normally, potatoes we eat don't have much of this toxin, but if they're exposed to light or start sprouting, they can become toxic.</p>
